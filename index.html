					Tractus is a fast paced, action packed FPS(First Person Shooter) set in space. The object of the game is to get to the other side of the light bridge and destory the enemy planet. 
					There are two different modes for the game: Single player and Multiplayer.
					
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>**WARNING** To play Tractus(Singe and Multiplayer) you must a Xbox 360 Windows controller plugged in!!</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					In Single Player you must fight through the forces stationed on the bridge and reach the enemy planet. Once you get there all you need to do is fire upon the planet, and defend 
					yourself against whatever the enemy throws at you.
				</p>
				<p>
					Multiplayer pits you and a friend against each with one simple goal: Destory the others planet. To help each player you planet spawns fighters to help you attack the enemy. 
					You must choose whether to go on the offensive and leave you minions behind or help defend your planet against the other player and let your minions do the attacking.

					</li>

						An array of planets that are unique to your own playthrough. Never will the planets configure themselves in space the same way twice.
