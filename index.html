					About
				</h2>
					<p>
						Hi, my name is Joe Ur. I am currently a student at NAIT in the DMIT program, specializing in
						Video Game programming. I am 21 years old living just north of Edmonton Alberta, and I am
						looking to become a game programmer.
					</p>
					<p>
						My main coding knowledge is in C# using the Unity game engine. I also do have a little bit of
						experience in HTML5, CSS, Objective-C,Java and SQL.
					</p>
					<P>
						The Games page shows off the lastest games/demos I have been working on, while the Resume page
						has a copy of my resume for viewing and downoading if need be. So thanks for stopping by and I 
						hope you enjoy!
					</P>
